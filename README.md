# Natural Language Processing

The Natural Language Processing - Arabic Text Classification Project's primary goal is the classification of Arabic text, particularly news. The project aims to create a robust natural language processing (NLP) system with the ability to precisely categorize news written in Arabic into three groupsâ€”entrepreneurship, science and technology, and other categories. 

In the project's first phase, data is gathered, which involves compiling 8,500 Arabic news articles from different sources. This dataset is available at the following URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asmaaabdelwahab/arabic-news-dataset

Three subject groups are created from the data, which is the foundation for further research and classification. The research applies machine and deep learning approaches to classify the texts. In deep learning, TensorFlow Keras is used to create a model with a first-layer Embedding and second-layer LSTM, while Scikit-learn is used to implement TF-IDF and a logistic regression model in machine learning. Recall, accuracy, and precision are some of the pertinent measures that are used to train and assess the models.
