Natural Language Processing - Arabic Text Classification Project

The project aims to develop an Arabic text classification system to categorize news articles into three main topics: entrepreneurship, science/technology, and others. This involves building a robust NLP model capable of accurately classifying the content.


In the initial phase, 8,500 Arabic news articles were gathered from various sources to form the dataset. Both machine learning (TF-IDF, logistic regression) and deep learning (TensorFlow Keras with Embedding and LSTM) approaches are being explored and evaluated using metrics like recall, accuracy, and precision.
